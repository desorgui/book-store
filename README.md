# Book Store

> The Bookstore is a website similar to the "Awesome Books" website built in the previous module. I have to create an MVP version of it that allows to 
- Display a list of books.
- Add a book.
- Remove a selected book.
By building this application, I will learn how to use React and Redux

## Built With

- React
- Html
- Css

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.
Copy the SSH code to download all the files.

### Prerequisites

- Github.
- Code editor.
- Git Bash
- Node Js

#### Setup

Open Git Bash and run
`git clone https://github.com/desorgui/book-store.git`

#### Install

Run `npm install` in the folder **_book-store_**

#### Test

Run 
`npx stylelint "**/*.{css,scss}"` to test css Linter
`npx eslint .` to test Javascript Linter
`npx hint .` to test html Linter

#### Usage

To run the server use, `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
